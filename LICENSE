PREAMBLE

WHEREAS, no formal software engineering principles were harmed (or used) 
in the making of this application;

WHEREAS, the test suite is "trust me bro";

NOW THEREFORE, behold the terms of this license:

ARTICLE I - ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF VIBES

1.1 NATURE OF THE CODE
    This application is VIBE-CODED. What does that mean? It means:
    - The code works (probably)
    - The architecture is "whatever felt right at the time"
    - Comments are sparse because the vibes were immaculate
    - If it breaks, the vibes were off that day
    - Unit tests? The real unit test is production

1.2 DEFINITION OF VIBE-CODING
    "Vibe-Coding" (n.): A development methodology where decisions are made 
    based on gut feeling, Stack Overflow snippets, and the desperate hope 
    that it'll work. Success rate: surprisingly high. Confidence level: 
    remarkably low.

ARTICLE II - THE "PLEASE DON'T SUE ME" CLAUSE

2.1 INVESTMENT DECISIONS
    If you are basing your actual investment decisions on this vibe-coded 
    application, you need to seriously rethink your life choices. Like, 
    really. We're talking fundamental reassessment here.

2.2 FINANCIAL ADVICE DISCLAIMER
    This is NOT financial advice. This is NOT investment advice. This is 
    barely even SOFTWARE advice. This is a toy built by someone who thought 
    "hey, wouldn't it be cool to visualize mutual fund data?" at 2 AM.

2.3 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
    If you do invest based on this app and things go sideways:
    - Don't blame me
    - Seriously, don't
    - I warned you (see Section 2.1)
    - The vibes are not legally binding
    - Your financial advisor is probably crying right now

2.4 NO WARRANTY WHATSOEVER
    This software comes with ZERO warranty. Not even the warranty of 
    "it probably won't set your computer on fire." Could it work perfectly? 
    Sure. Could it calculate that investing your life savings in a sketchy 
    mutual fund is a good idea? Also possible. The vibes are mysterious.

ARTICLE III - USAGE RIGHTS (AKA DO WHATEVER)

3.1 FREEDOM TO USE
    You can use this application however you want:
    - Personal use? Cool.
    - Commercial use? Go wild.
    - Teaching a course? Sure, why not.
    - Starting a hedge fund? Bold move, but okay.

3.2 FREEDOM TO MODIFY
    You are free to extend, modify, refactor, or completely rewrite this code:
    - Fork it (Don't laugh, I said fork)
    - Improve it (not hard, tbh)
    - Make it worse (also possible)
    - Add actual tests (you won't)
    - Deploy it to production (you absolute madlad)

3.3 THE AI CODING REALITY
    Let's be honest: you're probably not going to write a single line of 
    code yourself. You're going to:
    - Copy-paste into ChatGPT/Claude/Copilot
    - Say "make it better"
    - Ship whatever the AI spits out
    - Call it "agile development"
    
    And you know what? That's fine. This entire thing was vibe-coded anyway. 
    We're all just copy-pasting with extra steps. Welcome to 2025.

3.4 ATTRIBUTION
    Attribution is appreciated but not required. If you use this and make 
    millions, maybe buy me a coffee. Or don't. The vibes are chill either way.

ARTICLE IV - TECHNICAL DISCLAIMERS

4.1 CODE QUALITY
    The code quality ranges from "actually pretty decent" to "how does this 
    even work" depending on which file you're looking at and what time it 
    was written.

4.2 EDGE CASES
    Edge cases were handled by the sophisticated technique of "I'll deal 
    with it if someone complains." So far, the vibes have been protecting us.

4.3 SCALABILITY
    Will this scale? Probably not. Does it need to? Hopefully not. Is this 
    premature optimization? Definitely.

4.4 SECURITY
    Security measures include:
    - Hoping nobody tries to break it
    - Using libraries that probably handle that stuff
    - Vibes

ARTICLE V - MORAL RESPONSIBILITIES

5.1 BE COOL
    - Don't hammer ET Money's servers like a DDoS attack
    - Use rate limiting (it's in the code, because even vibes have limits)
    - Respect their ToS and robots.txt
    - Don't be that person who ruins it for everyone

5.2 EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES
    This is for learning and personal use. If you're a hedge fund manager 
    who stumbled on this repo, maybe hire actual developers?

ARTICLE VI - GOVERNING LAW

6.1 JURISDICTION
    This license is governed by the laws of common sense, the principle of 
    "don't be evil," and whatever jurisdiction thinks it has authority over 
    vibes.

6.2 DISPUTE RESOLUTION
    Any disputes shall be resolved by:
    - Taking a deep breath
    - Touching grass
    - Remembering this is free software written by vibes
    - Moving on with your life

---

TL;DR: Do whatever you want, don't blame me for your bad investments, 
and may the vibes be with you. 🚀
